STS9 first met in Pensacola, FL at the Ollie Java Cafe.  It was one of the first shows with keyboardist David Phipps, and truly began a new era of STS9.  El Buho toured the southeast with STS9 as his backup band, showing them the ropes of being touring musicians.  It was a great reunion, almost 7 years later, to play with El Buho in Colorado.  A lot has transpired since their first meeting, but the magic was still there.  We hope you enjoy these reunion improvs from STS9 and El Buho.
